## Installation

For Raspberry Pi deployment, see [RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md](RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Quick Start (Development)

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the installation script: `./install.sh`
3. Configure your API keys in `.env`
4. Initialize the journey: `npm run init-journey`
5. Start the service: `npm start`

### Production Deployment (Raspberry Pi)

For production deployment on Raspberry Pi with full automation:
- See [RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md](RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md) for automated installation
- See [MANUAL_RASPBERRY_PI_INSTALL.md](MANUAL_RASPBERRY_PI_INSTALL.md) if automated install fails
- See [AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md](AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md) for automation details

## Usage

### Automatic Operation
Once configured, the system runs fully automatically:
- Posts are generated daily at 8:00 AM (configurable)
- Travels automatically every 2-3 weeks or when content runs out
- No manual intervention required

### Manual Commands (for testing/debugging)
- **Generate a post**: `npm start -- --generate-post`
- **Move to new city**: `npm run move-next`
- **Create travel post**: `npm run travel-post`
- **Check status**: `pm2 status giovanni-blog`

### Full Automation Guide
See [AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md](AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md) for complete automation details.

## API Keys Required

- OpenAI API (for content generation)
- Google Places API (for finding real places)
- TripAdvisor Content API (for ratings, reviews, and enhanced location data)
- **Image Provider** (choose one):
  - Unsplash API (for photo search) OR
  - Freepik API (for AI image generation)
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)

## Image Provider Configuration

You can choose between Unsplash and Freepik for images by setting the `IMAGE_PROVIDER` environment variable:

### Unsplash (Default)
```bash
IMAGE_PROVIDER=unsplash
API_KEY_UNSPLASH=your_unsplash_access_key
```

### Freepik AI Generation
```bash
IMAGE_PROVIDER=freepik
API_KEY_FREEPIK=your_freepik_api_key
```

**Unsplash** searches for existing photos, while **Freepik** generates custom AI images based on text prompts. Freepik often provides more relevant and unique images for your specific travel content.

## Enhanced Image Generation

The system now generates more contextual and realistic images by incorporating:

- **Yesterday's Weather Context**: Uses locally stored weather data from the previous day to generate weather-appropriate images (e.g., sunny piazzas, rainy cobblestone streets)
- **City Specialties**: Automatically recognizes unique architectural and cultural features of each city:
  - Trulli houses in Alberobello, Italy
  - Canals and gondolas in Venice, Italy  
  - Thermal baths in Budapest, Hungary
  - Medieval castles in ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov, Czech Republic
  - And many more...
- **TripAdvisor Integration**: Enhances city data with real tourist information, ratings, and popular attractions
- **Local Weather Storage**: Stores today's weather data locally to use as "yesterday's weather" tomorrow, ensuring reliable weather context without depending on historical weather APIs

## Network Connectivity

The system includes automatic IPv4 optimization for Raspberry Pi environments. If you experience connection issues:
- IPv4 is automatically prioritized over IPv6
- 30-second timeouts for API requests
- Raspberry Pi DNS optimization included
